In this file, the content between the `---` lines is called front matter. It's where you define variables for the post. In this case, we're defining the layout to use (`post`), the title of the post (`Title of the Article`), the date of the post (`YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS`), and the category of the post (`topic2`).

The rest of the file is the content of the post, written in markdown. This includes headings, paragraphs, lists, and other markdown elements.
