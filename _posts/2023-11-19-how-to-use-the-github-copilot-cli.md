Finally after being for a year in private beta on githubnext it goes out into the public though it looks very different then githubnext presented it. 

First install gh which is the github cli. You can downlaod the msi from [here](https://cli.github.com/). Github cli is very good and intersting overall, because you can create issues, pr and much more directly from the command line without needing a web interface and it is rather easy to use. 

Then just follow the steps on the github page: https://github.com/github/gh-copilot of the github copilot cli.
