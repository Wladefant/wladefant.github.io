Finally after being for a year in private beta on githubnext it goes out into the public though it looks very different then githubnext presented it. 

First install gh which is the github cli. You can downlaod the msi from [here](https://cli.github.com/). Github cli is very good and intersting overall, because you can create issues, pr and much more directly from the command line without needing a web interface and it is rather easy to use. 

Then just follow the steps on the github page: https://github.com/github/gh-copilot of the github copilot cli.

And That is it you are done.

# Installing the private beta version
If you would like to install the private beta, you can do that as of right now by first installing npm and then [this](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@githubnext/github-copilot-cli) npm package and then follow the little instructions on the page. I like this version more because it does not prompt as much to get a result and you have these helpful shortcuts. 

# Private Beta vs Public Beta
many things have changed including the ease of use of the commands. During the GitHub Copilot CLI private beta, users had access to a set of concise helper commands that enhanced efficiency and streamlined workflows. These included ?? for arbitrary shell commands, git? for Git commands, and gh? for GitHub CLI commands. The new public beta of the Copilot CLI seems to be missing these helpful shortcuts.
