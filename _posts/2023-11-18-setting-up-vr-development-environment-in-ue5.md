In 2023 there are many headsets too consider, but if you havent decided yet, I would recommend the Oculus Quest 2. It is a standalone headset, which means you dont need a computer to run it. It is also very affordable, and has a lot of great games and experiences. It is also possible to connect it to your computer with a USB-C cable, and use it as a PCVR headset. This is great if you want to develop for PCVR, but dont want to buy a headset for that.

This is a general guide to set up a development environment in unreal engine 5

To set up your quest 2 read [this](_posts/2023-11-18-set-up-quest2.md) article first before going into this article.

To install and test apps from ue5 comfortably you will need to install steamvr. First install steam and install steamvr like a game. If you want to test out vr in ue5 always open steamvr first and leave it open.
