# How to install incompatible apps from Microsoft Store on Windows

If you canâ€™t install a specific app on from Microsoft Store because of the incompatibilty of your system requirements then you have to follow the following steps:

### 1. Check incompatibility

make sure the app does not support your system:

- Go to Microsoft Store

if there is no button then the app is incompatible with your system

### 2. Download App

To download the app from Microsoft Store you have first to install some dependencies of the app to fake the compatibility:

- on the App tap share and copy the link

- go to [https://store.rg-adguard.net/](https://store.rg-adguard.net/) and paste the link there

This is a website from Adguard **where you can download .appx files from the Microsoft store**. With it, you can access almost all the apps, games, and themes available in the Microsoft Store.

- now you have to download the file with the developer name on it (here: SAMSUNGELECTRONICS) with the file type extension .[...]bundle. For Example .AppxBundle, .msixBundle (not with e: .emsixbundle, eappxbundle)
- it should have the biggest size (here: 222 MB)

to download the file, copy and paste the link into your download manager or browser so the download can start (the path is not important)

### 3. Install App

After downloading the App you have to install it with the help of Microsoft Store:

- open the file that you have downloaded
- it should open a window of the Microsoft Store App Installer

- tap on install and your work should be done!!!

After the installation the app should open automically and should work like a normal Microsoft store App. Of course on some apps there are really incompatibilitys so that the app cant work on your system
