- Choose your headset (you can choose form Meta quest pro, quest 2, quest, rift s, rift)


you can choose between two connection methods: link(cable) and air link(wireless). We will choose the wireless method as it is much more comfortable and works rather good, but if you have any latency problems or conectivity issues you can always choose the wired method. 

## Set up AIR link 
- go into your quest
- click into the quick settings on the bottom right and then click on quest link
