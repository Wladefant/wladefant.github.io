# Wladefant's Blog

Welcome to Wladefant's blog. This blog is a simple markdown based blog where the articles are saved in markdown files in folders and the folders are topics. The blog is static and is displayed on wladefant.github.io.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You need to have the following installed on your machine:

- Git
- A text editor (like Sublime Text, Atom etc)

### Installing

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/wladefant/wladefant.github.io.git
```

2. Open the project in your text editor and start adding your articles in the `_posts` directory. Remember to follow the structure where each topic has its own folder and each article is a markdown file within the topic's folder.

## Usage

To add a new article to the blog, create a new markdown file in the appropriate topic folder under the `_posts` directory. The name of the markdown file should be the title of the article.

Write your article in markdown syntax in the markdown file. When you're done, commit and push your changes to GitHub. The blog will automatically update with your new article.
