My Main Projects are always on my [GitHub profile](github.com/wladefant).

This is a collection of some personal projects I've worked on that are easily viewable online. Anything that is not browser-friendly will not make the cut :(

I'm also **available for consulting**, so feel free to [contact me](/contact) if you'd like to work together.
